<h1> Stock Market Analysis <br> (Excel / VBA Demonstration) </h1>

#### Overview:
This project analyzed 3 years worth of stock market data to determine for every stock ticker:
* How much it's price changed at the close of the year compared to it's price at the opening of the year
* The percent change in price at the close of the year compared to it's price at the opening of the year
* The total volume of the stock for the year

Also, the stocks with the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease, and greatest total volume were identified.

All the raw data was contained in an excel workbook.  Because the file was very large, VBA scripts were written to perform
the analysis and addend the results to the datafile.

To examine the data files and the VBA script, their locations are indicated in the tree below.
